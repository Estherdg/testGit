You're talking about Inception? Earth's going tah tah. You might wanna do that thing where you find a new universe where you can suck yourself off. Cool. Just stay in the driveway; the kill-bots are live, and I took you off the whitelist. Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains. It's not all bad though, they were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle.

Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It's fine, everythings is fine. theres an infinite number of realities Morty, and in a few dozens of those i got lucky and turned everything back to normal. Slow down! I was just killing some snaked up here like everyone else, I guess, and finishing the Christmas lights.
